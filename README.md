# Blockchain-for-Transparent-Food-Distribution
## Project Description
Managing a global food supply chain is critical for ensuring sustainability and food security. As supply chains grow in complexity, involving multiple stakeholders across regions, they face numerous challenges, including inefficiencies, lack of traceability, and fraud.
### Key Challenges
1. Inadequate mechanisms for tracking and communication.
2. Increased operational costs.
3. Proliferation of counterfeit food products.
4. Poor warehouse monitoring practices.
## Purpose
This project aims to create a blockchain-powered solution that ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability in the food supply chain.
## Features
1. A global platform for end-to-end product traceability.
2. Prevention of counterfeit or duplicate products.
3. Optimized food distribution processes.
4. Lower operational costs in the supply chain.
## System Architecture
The solution employs a layered architecture to organize functionality systematically:

1. Application Layer: Interfaces for users to interact with the system.
2. Blockchain Layer: Core layer for data integrity and decentralized operations.
3. Infrastructure Layer: Provides the hardware and network support.
## Key Components
### 1. Traceability Module
Each product is assigned a unique serial code, linked to a blockchain-managed account.
Transactions are securely recorded in smart contracts and tied to the product's code.
Access control policies ensure that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
### 2. Trading Mechanism
Tracks product movement across entities on the blockchain.
Consumers register and request items using the serial code.
Ownership updates occur only after the request is validated, eliminating duplicate entries.
### 3. Reputation System
Builds trust between buyers and sellers.
Verified customers can leave immutable reviews about products or services.
Prevents sellers from tampering with negative feedback, preserving transparency and fairness.
